# fizz-buzz-console

The purpose of this exercise was to print the numbers 1 to 100 in the console. If the number is evenly divisible by 3, the word "Fizz" would be written in its place. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, the word "Buzz" would be written in its place. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" will be printed.

This is a simple console-based version of this exercise; future versions will contain a GUI. I created this with CSS and Javascript at https://codepen.io/jalex929/pen/mdqOKOG
